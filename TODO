apport-retrace:
 - add heuristics for more crash types (SEGV on read/write/exec & mem region)

python-apport:
 - Add API/report attribute for doing upstream problem reports
 - support /etc/apport/blacklist.d/ for check_ignored(): one exe
   per line
 - add field for nonstandard apt sources.list[.d/] lines

add firefox apport hook to suppress crash reports when restart is
necessary, and to not file crashes with flash installed

apport:
 - check crashes of root processes with dropped privs in test suite

dup detection:
 - add merging of two databases -> needs time stamp of last change
 - crash-digger should regularly consolidate the db -> track last date
   in db itself (new table)
