apport:
 - exit first instance quickly so that the crashed app can die instead
   of lingering on the desktop for a long time

problem_report.py:

apport-gtk:
 - drag&drop URL
 - add gksudo wrapper for disabling apport, and checkbox to crash
   dialog

kernel hook:
 - first call crashdump-helper and only create core dump if it exits
   with 0; this will avoid I/O trashing for core dumps which are just
   thrown away anyway (non-packaged binaries, repeatedly crashing
   programs, etc.)
 - core cannot be written for programs which cannot write into cwd
   (like many daemons) -> ask crashdump-helper for the path?

general:
 update-rc.d: defaults -> multiuser, sysv-rc >= 2.86.ds1-14.1ubuntu2,
 transition to remove superfluous scripts
