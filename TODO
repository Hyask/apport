apport:
 - exit first instance quickly so that the crashed app can die instead
   of lingering on the desktop for a long time

apport-gtk:

kernel hook:
 - first call crashdump-helper and only create core dump if it exits
   with 0; this will avoid I/O trashing for core dumps which are just
   thrown away anyway (non-packaged binaries, repeatedly crashing
   programs, etc.)
