Apport per-package hooks
========================

Binary packages can add additional fields (or even modify existing
fields, if they want) of Apport crash or bug reports by placing a
Python code snippet into

  /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/<packagename>.py

Apport will import this and call a function

  add_info(report)

and pass the currently processed problem report. This is an instance
of apport.Report, and should mainly be used as a dictionary. Please
see the Python help of this class for details:

  >>> import apport
  >>> help(apport.Report)
