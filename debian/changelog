apport (0.8) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * apport_utils.py:
    - Add two new functions seen_report() and mark_report_seen().
    - get_new_reports(): Only return unseen reports, add function
      get_all_reports() for the old behaviour.
  * gtk/apport-gtk.py: Do not delete reports after notifying about them. This
    way, we do not need to add another button to save the report (which is
    considered evil UI-wise), but still retain the report for filing and
    examining later.
  * Replace all usages of '/var/crash' to a new global variable in
    apport_utils; this is particularly useful for test suites.
  * apport.py: Overwrite old reports if they are seen.

apport (0.7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add apport_utils.py: Factorize out some common code of apport-gtk,
    possible future frontends, and some backend tools.
  * Add apport-checkreports: Test if there are new crash reports for the
    invoking user. This factorizes out the tests we currently do in
    update-notifier and makes them easier to change and keep in sync with
    apport itself. Ship the script in the apport package.

apport (0.4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Implement completely new UI according to the design described at
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CrashReporting. Many thanks to Matthew Paul
    Thomas!
  * po/Makefile: Fix default target to not just break. Now it builds the .pot
    file.
  * debian/rules: Build .pot file on package build for automatic Rosetta
    import.
  * Bring German translations up to date.
  * po/Makefile: Supply '--language=python' to intltool-update to properly
    extract strings from apport-gtk.

apport (0.3) edgy; urgency=low

  * debian/rules clean: Also clean po/.
  * debian/apport.cron.daily: Clean away empty files everytime.
  * apport: Only consider a report as already present if it has a non-zero
    size.
  * apport: Set proper group for report files instead of 'root'.
  * apport-gtk: Ignore 0-sized reports.
  * apport-gtk: Add button to remove the current report (by truncating the
    file to zero bytes; a user cannot unlink files in /var/crash).
  * apport-gtk: Only display reports that the user can actually read.
  * problem_report.py: Add 'binary' option to ProblemReport.load() to
    optionally skip binary data.
  * debian/rules: Clean stale *.pyc files.
  * python-gtk: Do not load binary data (core dumps, etc.) to greatly speed up
    the GUI. They are just gibberish anyway.
  * apport: Switch from apt_pkg to apt, add SourcePackage: to reports.
  * apport-gtk: Use source package name for the Malone URL.
  * debian/rules: Call setup.py install with --no-compile to not ship *.pyc in
    debs.

  * problem_report.py: Support iterators, add test case.

  * Add a simple GTK frontend, ship it in new package apport-gtk.
