.SH NAME

apport\-retrace \- regenerate a crash report's stack trace

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B apport\-retrace
[
.I OPTIONS
]
.I report

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B apport-retrace
regenerates the stack traces (both the simple and the threaded one) in
an apport crash report from the included core dump. This requires the
affected package to be installed, of course, and the installed version
has to exactly match the version from the crash report.

This is particularly useful if debug symbols were not available at the
time of the report generation, which is the common case. After 
installing all the debug symbols, the regenerated stack trace will
be fully symbolic and thus become much more useful for developers to
fix the problem.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-c, \-\-remove\-core

By default it is retained.

.TP

Write the new stack traces to stdout instead of putting them back into
the report.

.TP
.B \-o \fIFILE\fR, \fB\-\-output=\fIFILE
Write modified report to given file instead of changing the original
report.
