This file summarizes the major and interesting changes for each release. For a
detailled list of changes, please see ChangeLog.

1.1 (2009-04-20)
----------------
- Drop some remaining distro specific pieces of code.
- Add hookutils methods for attaching relevant packages, greatly improve
  attach_alsa() for sound problem debugging. 
- Move launchpad crash database implementation from ever-breaking
  python-launchpad-bugs (screenscraping) to launchpadlib (official and stable
  Launchpad API).
- Add new field Report.pid which gets set on add_proc_info() and can be used by
  hooks.
- setup.py: Properly clean up all generated files, install missing
  mimetypes/text-x-apport.svg icon symlink.
- Add README file.
- Add translations from Launchpad.
- Remove preloadlib/*; it's undermaintained, and not really useful any more
  these days.
- Various bug fixes; most visible being the misnamed etc/default/apport.default
  file (which should just be etc/default/apport).

1.0 (2009-04-06)
----------------
First upstream release, based on Ubuntu packaging branch; that had been the
de-facto trunk for many years, but this becomes unpractical with several
distributions using it now.
